1. Parallelize API Calls:
This way, all data can load simultaneously, reducing the overall load time.
In Flutter, you can use Future.wait to run multiple async operations at the same time.

Example Code:
Future<void> fetchMovies() async {
  final trendingMovies = fetchTrendingMovies();
  final popularMovies = fetchPopularMovies();
  final mostWatchedMovies = fetchMostWatchedMovies();

  final results = await Future.wait([trendingMovies, popularMovies, mostWatchedMovies]);

  // Process results
  final trending = results[0];
  final popular = results[1];
  final mostWatched = results[2];

  setState(() {
    // Update your state with the movie lists
  });
}

2. Show Placeholder Content:
While the movies are being fetched, show a skeleton or placeholder for each section.

3. Reduce Data Transfer Size
If the API allows it, request only the fields you need (like movie title, image, and rating)
instead of fetching all movie details. This reduces the payload size and speeds up loading.


4. Caching API Responses
Cache API results: Use a local caching solution to store the results of each section (trending, popular, and most-watched movies) so that subsequent app launches don't need to refetch the data immediately.
You can use local storage options like SharedPreferences or SQLite in Flutter

Example Code:

// Example using SharedPreferences to cache movie data in Flutter
Future<void> fetchMovies() async {
  final cachedMovies = await getCachedMovies();
  if (cachedMovies != null) {
    setState(() {
      movies = cachedMovies;
    });
  } else {
    // Fetch from API and cache the result
    final freshMovies = await api.fetchMovies();
    await cacheMovies(freshMovies);
    setState(() {
      movies = freshMovies;
    });
  }
}

5. Prefetch Data for a Smoother Experience
You can prefetch movies for the next screen (like all movies or details of trending movies)
when the user is idle or while loading the current screen. This can make transitions between screens feel instantaneous.
